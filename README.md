# HoriseonCleanUp

## The purpose of this is to clean up the code. It will either be deleting unnecessary information or consolidating. I started first by coming over the HTML file and fixing anything that I was able to catch. While doing that I made a list of changes that had been implemented. I then moved into the CSS file and did the same process.

## HTML

1. Changed 'title' from "website"
2. Changed 'span class=seo' into an "id"
3. Image tags needed 'alt' attribute
4. Under the 'div class=content' there were two "id=" that I deleted
5. Deleted last 'img' tag from "Cost Management"
6. Changed footers 'h2' into 'h4', 'h3' had already been used
7. Added sections to the HTML

---

## CSS

- Most of the changes I made here involved me changing or adding classes to the HTML file

1. Deleted ".header div ul {
   list-style-type: none;
   }" and nothing changed so it wasn't needed
2. Deleted "body {
   background-color: #d9dcd6;
   }" for the same reason and didn't see a change
3. Changed ".header h1 .seo" to "#seo"
4. Deleted the "p" selector because 16px is the default 
5. Grouped all the 12 classes from the 'div class=content' into 6 classes
6. Grouped the 10 classes from the 'div class=benefits' into 4 classes
7. Changed "footer h2" to "h4" 
8. Labeled the CSS into separate parts of the page to make finding sections easier
9. Moved "a" into the "General" section
10. The font "Calibri" was white while the rest of the fonts were orange so I added quotation marks but when I looked it up found only the CSS generic font family name needs to not have quotes. The others are fair play.

# Challenge1
The purpose of this is to clean up the code. It will either be deleting unnecessary information or consolidating.
---

## HTML
1. Change "title" from website
2. Image tags need "alt" attribute
3. Erased pointless "img" tag
4. Changed footers "h2" into "h4"
5. The 3 "h2" all became class= erasing the unnecessary id=
6. all "Calibri" had no quotes as well as a few other stray fonts ARIAL and SANS-SERIF but those might not need them?
---

## CSS
1. New classes to minimize number of css classes
2. Deleted ".header div ul {
    list-style-type: none;
}" for being unnecessary
3. combined benefit categories, h3 and images in new class= 
4. combined 3 sections under "content" 
5. changed "footer h4" to "h4"
6. deleted "body {
    background-color: #d9dcd6;
}"
7. changed from ".header h1 .seo" to ".seo"
8. Labeled all parts into sections
9. Moved "a" and "p" into *generald*sfd
10. rearranged so all parts flow smooth
11. Deleted "p" 16px is the default it doesn't need to be stated


arial and sans serif????
